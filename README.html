<h1>Collections</h1>

<p>This repo is a collection of sites that I&rsquo;ve made. Not all links are guaranteed to work all of the time.</p>

<p>For certain aspects, MAMP is required.</p>

<p>Any .html file will open in a browser and corresponding .html files should work accordingly.</p>

<p>The sites can be found here:</p>
